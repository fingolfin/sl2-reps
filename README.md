This package, `SL2Reps`, provides methods for constructing and testing matrix
presentations of the representations of SL(2,Z) whose kernels are congruence subgroups of SL(2,Z).

Irreducible representations of prime-power level are constructed individually by using the Weil representations of quadratic modules, and from these a list of all representations of a given degree or level can be produced. The format is designed for the study of modular tensor categories in particular.

## Installation

To install `SL2Reps`, first download it from `https://github.com/ontoclasm/sl2-reps`, then place it in the `pkg`
subdirectory of your GAP installation (or in the `pkg` subdirectory of any other GAP
root directory, for example one added with the `-l` argument).

`SL2Reps` is then loaded with the GAP command

`gap> LoadPackage( "SL2Reps" );`
