# The GAP package SL2Reps

This package, `SL2Reps`, provides methods for constructing and testing matrix presentations of the representations of `SL_2(Z)`.

Irreducible representations of prime-power level are constructed individually by means of Weyl representations, and from these a list of all representations of a given degree or level may be produced.

@Section Installation

To install `SL2Reps`, first download it from `TODO`, then place it in the `pkg` subdirectory of your GAP installation (or in the `pkg` subdirectory of any other GAP
root directory, for example one added with the `-l` argument).

`SL2Reps` is then loaded with the GAP command

`gap> LoadPackage( "SL2Reps" );`
