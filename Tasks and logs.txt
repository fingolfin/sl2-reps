		Details: 

		1.1.1. For MR, order tM/Agrp orbit according to kappa action, i.e., first list [x, y] such that [x, y] and [kappa x, kappa y] are in the same Agrp orbit, then list pairs [x, y], [kappa x, kappa y].

		1.1.2. For RepR, separate into 3 cases: p odd, p = 2, and the exceptional ones (18 of them?)
